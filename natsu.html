        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>Natsu is the brother of Zeref Dragneel, who was born over 400 years 
            before the start of Fairy Tail. When he was young, Natsu and his parents 
            were killed by a dragon. Desperate to get them back, Zeref researched 
            dark magic and resurrected Natsu as a demon known as E.N.D. From then on, 
            Natsu was raised by Igneel, the Fire Dragon King, who taught Natsu how to 
            read, write, and use his special Lost Magic, Fire Dragon Slayer Magic, 
            making Natsu a Dragon Slayer. After that, Igneel sealed his soul inside 
            Natsu's body and transported him 400 years into the future, hoping that he 
            could gain enough strength in that time to kill the evil dragon Acnologia. 
            After being sent to the future, Natsu believed Igneel abandoned him and went 
            on a journey to find the dragon. Eventually, Natsu was found by the master of 
            the Fairy Tail magic guild, who took him in and made him a member of Fairy Tail.            
        </p>
        <h2>Personality</h2>
        <p>Natsu is carefree and reckless in nature, and, despite his consistent brawls 
            with the other members of Fairy Tail, he is a fiercely loyal and protective 
            friend. He is willing to go down fighting for his friends, regardless of how 
            futile it might seem. Natsu has a straightforward mind, and often tackles issues 
            with a "hands on" approach. His solution to problems often involve violence. 
            Even when disrespected or faced with obvious hostility, Natsu rarely ever reciprocates 
            the feelings, and often forgoes grudge-holding. He did, however, for a short time, 
            hold a grudge against Jellal Fernandes, but eventually forgave him and considered 
            him an ally. He occasionally shows compassion for his enemies, such as when Cobra 
            was betrayed by Brain.
