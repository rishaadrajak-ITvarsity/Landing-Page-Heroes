        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>Goku was named Kakarot at birth by his father Bardock. 
            In the manga, Kakarot was born on Planet Vegeta three years 
            before its destruction, while in the anime Goku was born shortly 
            before the destruction of the planet. When Frieza destroyed 
            Planet Vegeta, Goku survived as he was being sent to Earth 
            on a routine infiltration mission to destroy all life on the planet 
            in order to sell it. After landing on Earth, the young Saiyan was 
            found in the woods by an old man named Gohan and became his adopted 
            grandson. Grandpa Gohan names him "Son Goku".
        </p>
        <h2>Personality</h2>
        <p>Goku is known for his cheerful, energetic personality 
            and his love of competition (specifically sport fighting and eating). 
            He has remarkable intuition at seeing the good in others in spite of 
            their actions, though his capacity for forgiving his enemies has 
            occasionally been criticized as excessive; Goku, for the most part, 
            only fights to win, and spares his enemies after defeating them only 
            for them to attack him when his back is turned.
