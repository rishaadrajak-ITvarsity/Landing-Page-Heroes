        <h1>About Us</h1>

        <p style="text-align: center;">This site is dedicated to the brave
            warriors that risk their lives to protect
            us from space-invaders, next-dimension villains,
            evil creations and all sorts of other baddies.
            <br/><br/>
            We appreciate you taking the time to remember and
            learn about those who fight, so that we have peace.
            <br/><br/>
            And remember... goku died for us... like 4 times!
