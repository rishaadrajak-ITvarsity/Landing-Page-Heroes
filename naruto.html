        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>He became the jinchūriki of the Nine-Tails on the day of his birth 
            — a fate that caused him to be shunned by most of Konoha throughout 
            his childhood. After joining Team Kakashi, Naruto worked hard to gain 
            the village's acknowledgment all the while chasing his dream to become 
            Hokage. In the following years, through many hardships and ordeals, he 
            became a capable ninja regarded as a hero both by the villagers, and 
            soon after, the rest of the world, becoming known as the Hero of the 
            Hidden Leaf. He soon proved to be one of the main factors in winning 
            the Fourth Shinobi World War, leading him to achieve his dream and 
            become the village's Seventh Hokage.            
        </p>
        <h2>Personality</h2>
        <p>Naruto is characterized as boisterous, exuberant, and unorthodox, 
            quite similar to Hashirama Senju. He inherited his mother's verbal 
            tic, as he ends his sentences with "Dattebayo!" (だってばよ!) when 
            excited or frustrated. Though he responds best to competition and is 
            not afraid to ask for assistance, Naruto is relatively naive, 
            simple, and slow to understand principles or situations. He often 
            requires an oversimplified analogy in order to grasp explanations, 
            and can even forget some concepts that he himself noted earlier if 
            he is too emotional. Naruto is aware of his faults and admits he acts 
            strong to mask his embarrassment and frustration about them. Despite his 
            naivety, Naruto can be quite observant, picking up on things others miss 
            and retaining information casually gathered through conversation.
